SpaceDash is an open-source app that provides information of SpaceFlights. SpaceDash also includes news and updates regarding all vehicles and missions.

The app is currently in the second stage of development and several new features are being scoped/built. These features include an AR view of various vehicles of SpaceX and event updates from even more Space Agencies!

The project uses test-drive agile development processes, where requirements are turned into test cases, and code is improved upon. 

***Notice***

Currently, new version was not accepted by the App Store review team. Since there was recent update to the r/SpaceX API which caused our app to crash on launch and no way to update our App I removed it from the App Store as of now. The team is working to add functionality to the app which will become Version 2 of the app. Version 2 of the will be available in early to mid January. To still use and test the app, you can use the beta version using Testflight link above.
